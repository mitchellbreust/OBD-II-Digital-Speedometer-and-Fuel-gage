# OBD-II-Digital-Speedometer-and-Fuel-gage
This project leverages an embedded system to create a real-time digital speedometer display for vehicles. By interfacing with the vehicle's OBD-II port, the system reads and displays the current speed, estimated fuel usage per 100km, and fuel percentage on a 3.5-inch screen.
